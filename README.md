# Hostfile collection

[Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1boii/hosts/main/hosts)

See the wildcards file for patterns and the no-domain file for IP address based hosts.

The contents of this repo are more or less regularly merged into https://github.com/Sinfonietta/hostfiles so that they finally end up in the porn category of https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts
It is advised to use one of the above repos instead of this one. I only created this repo so that I can pull in changes into my pihole after they've been committed.
